TODO
----
- Need a log file, mapping job_id and parameters.
  - Job request
	  - Received
		- Served
		- Failed
	- Job completion
		- Received
		- Served
		- Failed: I haven't seen it fails.

- When a cluster doesn't start in 6 mins, kill the instances. Cancel the spot
	requests.


Not sure
--------
- term-inst.py
	- Kill a specific instance with the inst_id


Done
----
- When a job controller sees an acorn-server cluster with less than 11 nodes
	for 6 mins, terminate the cluster. job-controller will get the job request in
	1 hour after the visibility timeout.  This happens quite often, due to the
	spot price increase. Setting the spot request price really high can be a good
	idea too.

- term-inst.py
  - Kill all instances without job_id

- Pick an AZ with the lowest last-day max pricing.
