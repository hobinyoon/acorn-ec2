- When a cluster doesn't start in 6 mins, kill the instances. Cancel the spot
	requests.


Not sure
--------
- term-inst.py
	- Kill a specific instance with the inst_id


Done

- When a cluster doesn't finish within 1 hr, kill it. It happens with a 11 node
	cluster. One example is that one of the nodes didn't clone code from
	github.com
    sudo: unable to resolve host ip-172-31-17-235
		Cloning into '/home/ubuntu/work/acorn-tools'...
		fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/hobinyoon/acorn-tools.git/': Could not resolve host: github.com

- When a job controller sees an acorn-server cluster with less than 11 nodes
	for 6 mins, terminate the cluster. job-controller will get the job request in
	1 hour after the visibility timeout.  This happens quite often, due to the
	spot price increase. Setting the spot request price really high can be a good
	idea too.

- term-inst.py
  - Kill all instances without job_id

- Pick an AZ with the lowest last-day max pricing.
