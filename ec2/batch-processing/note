TODO

- Need a log file, mapping job_id and parameters.
  - Job request
	  - Received
		- Served
		- Failed
	- Job completion
		- Received
		- Served
		- Failed: I haven't seen it fails.

- When a job controller sees a cluster with less than 11 nodes for 10 mins,
	kill it. If happens quite often, due to the spot price increase. Might be a
	good idea to set the price really high.

- When a cluster doesn't start in 6 mins, kill the instances. Cancel the spot
	requests.


Not sure
--------
- term-inst.py
	- Kill a specific instance with the inst_id


Done
----
- term-inst.py
  - Kill all instances without job_id

- Pick an AZ with the lowest last-day max pricing.
